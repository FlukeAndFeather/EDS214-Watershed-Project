# Concentration calculation of Potassium, Nitrate, Magnesium, Calcium and Ammonium in four watersheds of Puerto Rico.

This repository contains the concentrations of (a) potassium, (b) nitrate-N, (c) magnesium, (d) calcium and (e) ammonium-N in four Bisley streams namely; Quebrada uno-Bisley (Q1), Quebrada dos-Bisley (Q2), Quebrada tres-Bisley (Q3) and Puente Roto Mameyes (MPR).

All analysis were done on R Version 2025.05.1 using the following libraries: tidyverse, janitor, here, and zoo.

# Contents

This repository contains the following documents
1. data = The folder includes all the raw data of the watersheds and helps you with the computation. The data can be accessed through <https://doi.org/10.6073/PASTA/F31349BEBDC304F758718F4798D25458>.
2. RScript = This folder contains all the files with the codes that will run the full statistical and visual representation.
3. figs = This folder contains all the visual representation that is derived from the raw data, and will run through the scripts in the folder RScript.
