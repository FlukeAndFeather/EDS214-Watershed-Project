## Background

This repository presents visual representation of a) potassium, (b) nitrate-N, (c) magnesium, (d) calcium and (e) ammonium-N ions before and after hurricane Hugo in Puerto Rico. Four watersheds namely Quebrada uno-Bisley (Q1), Quebrada dos-Bisley (Q2), Quebrada tres-Bisley (Q3) and Puente Roto Mameyes (PRM) at the Luquillo Mountain of Puerto Rico were taken as a sample sites to calculate time-series plots of 9 weeks moving average from year 1988 to 1994.
