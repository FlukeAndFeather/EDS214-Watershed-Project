I have tried to make the variable and function name descriptive and consistent.


## Collaboration

My participation in the peer feedback went well. My cohort gave me a feedback that helped me revise and update my work. I gave my cohort some constructive feedback on the intermediate outputs, README and the naming convention.
She incorporated that into her work.
